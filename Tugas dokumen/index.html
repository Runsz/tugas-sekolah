    <p>
        Dear Eileen,<br><br>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's
        science faculty to study as part<br>of your PhD next year. I will answer your quostion one by one,
        in the following sections.
    </p>
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>
        We are happy to accommodate yoou starting your study with us at any time, however ut would suit us

    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li> Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>

        You can find more information about <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_table_borders.asp">
        important university dates</a> on our website.
    </p>
    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects 
        fall<br>
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, 
        and just<br>
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we were most 
        intrigued<br>
        by are as follows, in order of priority:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the healt benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12
            </sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk baswplayers at temperaturess exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>
            C(86<sup>o</sup>F),when the<br>
            audiance size expontetially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>
            4</sup>.)</li>
        <li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representating scores.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        So please can you provide more information pn each of these subjects, including how long you;d expect 
        the <br>
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? 
        Thanks.
    </p>
    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer 
        your question,<br>
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
    </p>
    <p>
        Polynesian chicken dance
        <blockquote> 
                    little knows but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village 
                    would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be 
                    "fruitful".
        </blockquote>
        Icelandic brownian shuffle
        <blockquote> 
                    the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this 
                    dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling 
                    their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students 
                    used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
        </blockquote>
        Arctic robot dance
        <blockquote> 
                    interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to 
                    have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilled movements, being 
                    practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered 
                    that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.
